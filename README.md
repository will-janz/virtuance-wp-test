Virtuance WordPress Test
========================

This was a small test for Virtuance used to test my skills in PHP, JSON, AJAX, HTML/CSS, and JSON to HTML. Wordpress is unfamiliar to me, and I got to dive right in on theming and admin AJAX integration. While Material Design is familiar, Materialize was a new library for me, and I love it.
