Virtuance WordPress Test
========================

This was a small test for Virtuance used to test my skills in PHP, JSON, AJAX, HTML/CSS, and JSON to HTML. Wordpress is unfamiliar to me, and I got to dive right in on theming and admin AJAX integration. While Material Design is familiar, Materialize was a new library for me, and I love it. 

The main goal was to test my ability to use REST APIs (browser <-> wp-admin) and integrate JSON data into HTML via AJAX. If this were a production site, I would:
 * Add more content, including some images
 * Adjust the spacing in the navbar
 * Darken the theme a little; bright red and white is hard on my eyes
